Ansible is an open-source automation platform that is used to manage and configure both applications and systems. It is built on top of the Python programming language and uses a declarative language called YAML for defining automation workflows. Ansible allows users to define their infrastructure as code and execute it using an agentless architecture.

The Ansible architecture consists of two main components:

1. Control Machine: The control machine is the computer from which the Ansible commands are executed. It can be a local computer or a remote computer.

2. Managed Nodes: These are the target systems or devices that Ansible will manage. These nodes can be physical or virtual machines, as well as network devices, such as routers and switches. The managed nodes must have an SSH server running on them in order for Ansible to connect to them.
